# Analysis-of-Urban-Walkability
Conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the relationship between urban walkability, socioeconomic and urban planning factors using machine learning algorithms, enabling efficient calculation of key urban metrics.

1. Introduction
Walkability, an essential element of urban planning, focuses on making walking safe and convenient in cities, with accessible transportation options nearby. A key aspect of building vibrant, sustainable cities is the comprehension of pedestrian movement and its connection to factors like transit access and destination accessibility. Urban planners, policymakers, and researchers benefit from a walkability index, which quantitatively measures pedestrian-friendliness, for prioritizing investments and informed land use decisions. Our research in this context involves analyzing urban walkability and its determining factors through machine learning methods. Our goal is to offer valuable insights for urban planners and communities seeking to improve walkability and create healthier, pedestrian-friendly spaces by analyzing job-housing balance, land use diversity, traffic measures, demographics, and employment factors.
1.1 Problem and Background
The significance of promoting walking as the main mode of transportation has been accentuated by rapid urbanization, calling for advancements in urban design and transportation infrastructure. Walkable cities require a detailed understanding of the complex relationships between urban factors. We are researching to bridge this gap by examining the intricate nature of urban walkability patterns and their interplay with diverse urban variables.
1.2 Project Goals
Enhancing urban design, sustainable transportation, and pedestrian-friendly environments is the goal of our project. We achieve this by analyzing population
dynamics, job structures, land use, and transit to provide actionable insights for urban planners, legislators, and communities.
1.3 Research Questions
Building upon our investigation of urban walkability factors, our goal is to further explore the intricacies of creating pedestrian-friendly environments. Thus, our research aims to understand the complex connections between these factors and how they affect walkability. Our goal is to provide valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and communities seeking to create vibrant, sustainable, and pedestrian-friendly cities by addressing key research questions.
The primary research questions for this project are:
1. Does neighborhood walkability correlate with job-housing balance?
2. What is the impact of combining retail, office, and residential land use on walkability scores?
3. Is it possible to use traffic measures as a predictor for areas with high walkability?
4. Can we find a correlation between demographics, like auto ownership rates, and observed walkability?
5. In what ways do employment variables influence neighborhood walk scores?
   
1.4 Research Problem and Context
Our research problem arises from the necessity of unraveling the intricacies of urban walkability patterns and their relationship to diverse urban factors. While previous tries might have concentrated on factors, a complete comprehension is necessary to enhance urban walkability.

1.5 Stakeholders, Decision-Making, and Predictive Modeling
Walkabilityâ€™s immense influence on quality of life, health, and economic vibrancy is recognized by key urban planning stakeholders, including legislators, city officials, and residents. Determining the functionality of urban space to enhance walkability is a complex process that requires considering urban planning, transportation, public health, and community development. To effectively analyze future walkability scores and highlight areas for improvement, the use of predictive modeling techniques is essential. Predictive modeling improves urban decision-making and enhances walkability by optimizing resources and strategies.

2.2 Research Study
Hauer et al. (2021) (Hauer, 2021)presented groundbreaking approaches to natural language processing by exploring sense annotation through translations, both in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. While it may not be specifically focused on urban walkability, this study showcases how innovative approaches can be used to tackle intricate research challenges, reflecting the demand for creative solutions in urban planning.
2.3 Similar Problems
The literature review by De Vos et al. (2022) introduced a conceptual model and research agenda, aiming to deepen our understanding of perceived walkability. Through the synthesis of existing research and the proposal of future directions, this study presents a roadmap for addressing comparable challenges in urban walkability research. Hijriyah et al. (2023) utilized systematic literature review techniques to examine trends in walkability research, highlighting the significance of comprehensive methodologies in analyzing complex urban phenomena.
2.4 Conclusion
By examining the literature, we uncover the various facets of urban walkability and the potential of machine learning to address challenging real-world problems. This review establishes a foundation for empirical analysis in urban walkability research by integrating insights from urban planning theories, behavioral frameworks, and machine learning methodologies. This review carefully examines biases, limitations, and relevant studies to establish the framework for informed decision-making and future research in urban planning and machine learning integration.
